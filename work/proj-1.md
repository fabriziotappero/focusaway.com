[TRS Motorcycles](http://www.trsmotorcycles.com/) is a fresh and dynamic motorcycle manufacturer built by the hands
of the seven time World champion [Jordi Tarres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordi_Tarr%C3%A9s_(motorcycle_trials_rider)).

This video was commissioned by TRS Motorcycles and shows the amazing trajectory of
this company and the top-class bike construction with the lightest engine of its class.

The current official TRS Motorcycles rider is the incredible Red Bull rider and six time
motorbike World champion [Adam Raga](http://adamraga.es/).
