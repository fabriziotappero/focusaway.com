Focus Away tries very hard to apply the art of cinematography to the
act of filming a wedding.

What does that mean?

Simple, we avoid the cheesy look and stereotypical situations and we go for the
beauty of the moment, sometimes the peculiar or atypical beauty of the people,
and sometimes for the still elegance of people and situations.

We work with what people wear, in how people interact and we put lots of energy
in knowing locations.

We specialise in Barcelona and surrounding but we always make it about the people.

For us the wedding video filming is a complementary activity to art filming, documentary
filming as well as short cinematography. Have a look at our other works.
