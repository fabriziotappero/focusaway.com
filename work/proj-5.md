Sometimes, to refine my abilities in the art of video crafting I like to
help out other video makers and professionals in their creations.

A bit by chance I ended up helping out on set for the creation of the music
video for the song Born Ready. **I like to clarify that my role in the creation
of this video was totally marginal**.
