The [GSMA Mobile World Congress (MWC)](https://www.mobileworldcongress.com/) is
the World's largest exhibition for the mobile phone industry that takes place
every year in February, or sometimes in March, in Barcelona, Spain.

For 30 years the MWC has been the time in which mobile phone operators,
phone manufacturer and technology providers come together and show to nearly
100,000 attendees the latest and greatest products and services related to the
mobile industry. Representatives from companies like LG, Sharp, Intel, IBM, Ebay,
Visa come together to present exciting products and services that would do
shape the way we live.

#### MWC Hosting City
Despite the existence of two other similar mobile phone exhibits, the actual
Spanish MWC is the most important mobile phone exhibit and it is hosted is the
city of [Barcelona, Spain](https://goo.gl/maps/2thCVox7URN2).

Having actually lived in Barcelona for over 6 years I can surely tell you that
the MWC time is a time in which the city heavily transform so that all sort of
services can be offered. Beside hotel rooms and taxies being impossible to find,
other supporting services work in full swing. Photographers and Video makers
are certainly a class of people who do offer their services to MWC attendees and
companies.

#### Best Chance for Networking
When a company decides to comes to Barcelona and attend the Mobile World Congress
it is very likely to want to use photography and video services. Been a highly
networking and marketing-oriented event, the MWC gives a unique chance for
a company to tell people who they are why what they do actually matters.

As it has always been, in a competitive business environment it is important to
maximize the *splash factor*. A successful company that comes to Barcelona to
attend the MWC should definitely look at:
- Maximize the interaction with other MWC companies and attendees.
- Actively create the chance to meet privately with key representatives and
decision-makers from other influencing companies.
- Create unique marketing material out of the time in the MWC that can be used
periodically via social channels.
- Document the MWC visit to portrait oneself as an influencer in its own
business sector.
- Capture as much as possible and in great detail what is going on during the
exhibit. Keynote presentations, products presentation and more.
