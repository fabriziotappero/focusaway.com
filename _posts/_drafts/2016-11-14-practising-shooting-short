Spain is one of best and most popular filming location in the World. In the 1960s, directors of the size of Sergio Leone did help Spain to become a popular destination
for movie producers and filmmakers.

Despite the competition of beautiful filmmaking-appropriate places in Easter Europe, Spain can certainly
be considered one of the number one European shooting location because of the diversity of its locations, its geographical accessibility from abroad, the great
weather, cost-effective labor and of course small important factors like the quality
of food, the hospitality and the fact that Spain is a very safe place.

Spain is the home of great films like Cohen's 2012 The Dictator, Justin Lin's blockbuster Fast and Furious 6, Game of Thrones from HBO in 2015, major TV drams like Emerald City starring Vincent D'Onofrio, Alejandro Amenabar thriller Regression in 2014, the mithical Doctor Who by BBC and an uncountable number of car commercials and TV commercials in general.

#### Legalities
Filming in Spain is easy. Please mind that villages, cities and regions have distinct rules regarding the use of public spaces in Spain.

The City Police (Guardia Urbana) Information and Permits Office is responsible
for giving permission to film in public spaces in the city like in Barcelona.

If you are a SMALL CREW (10 people and 1 camera with tripod), shooting in Barcelona
is free of charge, all you need to do is just ask for permission at the [Barcelona Film Commission](http://www.bcncatfilmcommission.com/en/shooting-barcelona). If you
are not a small crew the Barcelona Film Commission will let you shoot by paying a reasonable fee that ranges between 600€ for filming and 350€ for advertisement.

If you do not use any tripod, hence you do not occupy city space, you will NOT NEED to ask for any permission.

Free and non-free permission enquiries can be put down [here](http://bcncatfilmcommission.com/en/roda-amb-nosaltres/forms).
