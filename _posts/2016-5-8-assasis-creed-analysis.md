The French company Ubisoft Entertainment SA is a 3 billion Euros company dedicated
to the development of videogames.
In October 2015 Ubisoft released their new Assassin's Creed videogame named
Assassin's Creed Syndicate. As expected, the success was huge.

Youtubers and movie makers of the caliber of
 [Davin Super Tramp](https://www.youtube.com/user/devinsupertramp/videos)
 and
 [Rocket Jump](https://www.youtube.com/user/freddiew/videos) have been
asked to produce a trailer for those Assassin's Creed releases. Here you can watch
what the guys at [Rocket Jump](https://www.rocketjump.com/) came up with.

One of the many incredible trailers from Davin Super Tramp can be found here.

There is actually no need to say how successful all these videos have been for the
marketing of the videogame as well as for the publicity of the video makers.

I find quite interesting how immensely talented Filmmakers would no only use
YouTube as their main video releasing channel but would also embark in creating
promotional/story-telling videos for video games company like Ubisoft.

[Looking at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8b1zWOgOKA) the number of views
(36M at the time of writing) of some Assassin's Creed promo video that Devin Super Tramp made
it is quite clear that people really like them. Also, you will find interesting
to know that the actual [official trailer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzCEdSKMkdU) from Ubisoft has about half the number of views of Devin's video!
