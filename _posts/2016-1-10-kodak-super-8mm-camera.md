hum... a lot can be said about Kodak and its bold move to build and sell a digital camera
that is actually... analogic.

Kodak has made an analogic camera where you actually put 8mm film in it. The other
interesting thing that they did is actually let you send them the film you just
shot so that they can send you back a 4K digital version of it.

But why film? Well, this camera actually allows you to shoot 4K footage
with a camera that costs only about US$500 plus $50 for the development of the film.
All in all... an interesting setup.

The Kodak Super 8mm camera is compact cure camera that comes with a digital LCD, a microphone
input and C-mount lens and, of course, a super 8mm film slot.

In my opinion, it is nice to know that, out there, there are companies that just don't
follow the digital trend but instead try to define what the digital trend is.
