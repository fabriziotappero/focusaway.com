Developing and bringing a new product into an crowded marketplace is a hard task. Unlike large
corporations, small companies and start-ups can dedicated smaller budgets for marketing
and advertisement. Video content is the most direct and effective way to tell people
who you are, what you do and why you matter.

#### Effectively Engage your Audience
For the majority of the small, medium and large companies any important marketing and
advertising action takes place in or is heavily influenced by the ever-expanding universe
of Internet. It is a fact that on the Internet the attention span of users continues
to decline.

Unlike 10 years ago, text or images are nowadays simply not enough to express the
importance of your work and products or the usefulness of your services. Potential clients
need more information from you and they need it with less words and in less time.

Users are nowadays very informed, they expect to know everything even before
being ready to talk about buying. Detailed product reviews and opinions matter more than ever.

Short and slick videos are the most engaging and effective tools to get your message across
and to let others to connect with your business. If you are a small company or a
start-up and you have limited marketing resources, a short and to-the-point video can
very well be your best marketing investment.

#### Customised and High Content Videos Increase your Internet Visibility

YouTube is the second biggest search engine in the World, the first being Google.
Well crafter and emotionally relevant videos are your best bet to get to people who
want to buy from you.

Furthermore, it is widely known that webpage ranking in itself is heavily influenced
by fresh content creation (e.g. blog posts) and by the presence of video content in the
for of, for instance, a YouTube channel.

If you wonder how much video content you should be making, there isn't really a single
answer. For some companies a video every month or two is adequate, while for other
companies several videos a week might be necessary. It all depends on your
online competitors, your marketing goals and of course your product.

#### What Video Content is Right for Me
A classic corporate video is particularly useful to define and support your brand,
especially as part of your website, at a congress in your field or for targeting
a generic audience. A corporate video is almost never useful to reach new customers
online and drive traffic to your website.

Multiple short videos that can either be watched as a series and targeted at different
segments of your customer base are the ideal tool to drive new customers to you.

By thinking about your online video strategy as an on-going campaign rather than a
one-off project, you will open countless possibilities for how you can reach a
larger audience. This is particularly true for small companies with limited resources.

#### Hard Sell Approach is Out, welcome Branded Advertisement.

Advertising on television or print used to be quite heavy handed. About any
commercial made before the 1990's was pretty direct and quite forceful.
In the past years a Hard Sell approach was taken almost 100% of the time.

The Internet came along 15 years ago and since then the average consumer has grown into
a more tasteful consumer. And this has made "branded advertisement" the most suitable
advertisement for the Internet. Surprisingly enough, this has trained the average Joe to
be actually quite resilient to Hard Sell and actually quite sensitive to the emotional
aspects of branded advertisement.

The type of advertisement used in the Internet World has actually made it
to the TV when advertising agencies began realizing that the customer online response
was actually far better than their TV spots. This changed the game very quickly.

Television is not really the best place for branded content. However there is a subgroup of TV
commercials that actually are something in between the branded Internet ads and the
classic TV ads. This type of commercials are designed to evoke an emotion or
feeling that perfectly represents the brand. Rather than beating the viewer over
 the head with information about a product.

These spots connect with the viewer on an emotional level. Letting the viewer
know how their product will make them feel, not by telling them
but by gently guiding them. This very recent airbnb.com ad is a good example of this
type of ad.
