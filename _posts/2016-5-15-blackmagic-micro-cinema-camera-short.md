Noam Kroll is a very talented film maker from Los Angeles, USA. Noam is as well
a guy who likes cameras from the Australian Camera manufacturer Blackmagic Design
and recently he put together a cute 1min short done with a Blackmagic micro cinema camera.

I came across Noam's work a bit by accident while browsing the Internet. And a
bit by accident I watched his very good 1 min shot film MICRO.

MICRO is a short film that Noam made during one weekend to test out the Blackmagic
Micro Cinema Camera. Image quality is spectacular and the actual narrative of the
short MICRO was so good that I decided to do a video essay about it.

Please have a look at it.

As Noam mentions in way more details in [his website](http://noamkroll.com/) the
shortfilm MICRO was shot on the following lenses:\\
Tokina 11-16mm, Rokinon 24mm, Rokinon 50mm, Nikkor 50mm, Zeiss 85mm.

The short MICRO was shot in RAW 3:1 and colored in DaVinci Resolve and
FilmConvert. Below you can see the actual footage before and after coloring.
